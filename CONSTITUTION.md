When completing the Student Organization Registration Forms on-line, all student organizations must upload a copy of their constitution. The best constitutions are those that are clear, concise, easily implemented, and include guidelines for all of the group’s essential components. Your constitution will be reviewed by your CSI student organization advisor for key elements and language, and in certain cases you may be asked to provide clarification or further information based on your proposed purpose, activities, or history. In order to expedite the registration process, we have created an optional template for your use. It contains updated language and requirements as mandated by UCSD and CSI policy.
*All constitutions must contain items listed in Articles 1-7 below. Further articles to consider are listed later on in this document.

# Constitution

## Article I. Name of Student Organization*

The organization shall be called Open Source at UCSD. 


## Article II. Statement of Purpose

The mission of Open Source @ UCSD is to build an inclusive open source community at UC San Diego.


## Article III. Nonprofit Statement*

Open Source at UCSD is a non-profit student organization. 

## Article IV. Requirements for Membership*

Any UC San Diego undergraduate student may be a member of Open Source at UCSD. No fees are required. 

To become a member, a student must demonstrate interest to the [TODO club officer] each quarter. The [TODO club officer] will keep track of all students who have demonstrated interest, and they will all be members for that quarter. Each member must re-new their interest every quarter to continue being a member. 

Additionally, each member must adhere to the Code of Conduct. Should a member violate the Code of Conduct, their privileges including their membership could be revoked based upon the majority decision reached by the entirety of the board after a hearing with said member. If officers are not present for the hearing, their vote defaults to clemency. If the member being reviewed is a board member, the hearing process still occurs but the board member being reviewed does not have any input on the decision.

Updates to the Code of Conduct can be made by a majority decision reached by the board.


## Article V. Frequency of Organization Meetings*

[Insert information about how often your org will meet here. You may include what, if any, rules there may be about holding meetings.]

```
How often will your organization meet?
Will there be a required number of meetings each quarter? Each year?
Will minutes be taken and/or required for official meetings? 
NOTE: Minutes can be useful for disseminating information to members who can’t make it, as well as for officially recording organization procedure and decision-making.
```
There will be a quarterly general body meeting for all members, biweekly meetings for board members, and no required meetings for general members. Meeting minutes will be taken for general body meetings and all board meetings. 

## Article VI. Qualifications for Holding Office and Methods of Selecting and Replacing Officers*

Only registered UCSD students may hold office in the organization. Only registered UCSD students may vote in elections for the selection of the organization’s officers.

When an officer is, for whichever reason and in whichever manner, no longer a physical member of the OpenSource
club at UC San Diego, the committee must arrange for two voting sessions in which all members of the club must
be physically present. Any member who does not hold an officer position is eligible to run for the position.
The member who results in holding the position after the two voting sessions must have their name placed in 
the current record of official club committee information.
The two stages will be: 

1) Vote for exactly one the position contestants of the club who you feel would be a good fit for the no longer held officer
position as well as sufficiently being able to manage this new duty concurrently with their current duties.

2)From the potential contestants from the first voting session, one final member must be voted for. This potential
castie must win by the majority vote and no other voting system. In the case of a tie, recursively flip a coin
until only one member is chosen for the officer position. 

In the case of attempting to remove an officer from the club, one voting session must be held. In this voting session,
a mimimum of 50% consensus must be obtain to formally remove the officer and remove their information from the current
record of official club committee information.
