When completing the Student Organization Registration Forms on-line, all student organizations must upload a copy of their constitution. The best constitutions are those that are clear, concise, easily implemented, and include guidelines for all of the group’s essential components. Your constitution will be reviewed by your CSI student organization advisor for key elements and language, and in certain cases you may be asked to provide clarification or further information based on your proposed purpose, activities, or history. In order to expedite the registration process, we have created an optional template for your use. It contains updated language and requirements as mandated by UCSD and CSI policy.
*All constitutions must contain items listed in Articles 1-7 below. Further articles to consider are listed later on in this document.
